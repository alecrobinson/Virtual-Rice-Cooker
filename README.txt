README:


This is the implementation assignment. This is a virtual rice cooker, which assumes that it's running in a room 21 degrees Celsius, with an arbitrary amount of rice. It prints out when it is done, and some basic information about what stage it is on, and how much it is modifying the inputs. 

To run with Python 3.5.1:

Put Fuzzy_Logic_2016_share_351.py in the same directory as virtual_rice_cooker_351.py


To run with Python 2.7.11 or earlier:

Put virtual_rice_cooker_2xx.py into the same directory as the one containing the version of Fuzzy_Logic_2016_share.py


Execute virtual_rice_cooker_351.py

There are no functions to invoke or change while it runs


Enjoy the virtual rice!
